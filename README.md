# üå°Ô∏è PID Temperature Control System with MSP430 + MATLAB GUI

This project implements a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** controller using an **MSP430 microcontroller** and a **MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI)** to regulate the temperature of a **thermo-electric cooler (TEC)**. It demonstrates how embedded hardware and desktop software can work together for real-time temperature monitoring and control.

## üì¶ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a closed-loop control system capable of maintaining a user-defined temperature using feedback from a temperature sensor. A PID algorithm was implemented on the MSP430 MCU to control the power to a TEC. Users could set the desired temperature and tune the PID gains through a MATLAB GUI that also displayed the real-time temperature profile.

## üîß PID Tuning

The PID parameters were determined using the **Ziegler-Nichols tuning method**:

- **K<sub>P</sub> = 540**  
- **K<sub>I</sub> = 7**  
- **K<sub>D</sub> = 1.75**

These parameters provided a well-tuned response with good stability and minimal overshoot.
